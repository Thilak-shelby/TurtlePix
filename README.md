Overview:
TurtlePix is a Java program that draws turtles using clean, modular, and reusable code. Each turtle is made up of parts like the body, head, legs, tail, and facial features. The project shows how to use Object-Oriented Programming to build complex shapes from simple components. 

Features:
Modular Design: The turtle is built from different classes for each part, making the code easy to maintain and extend.

Dynamic Scaling: Turtles can be drawn at different sizes without losing quality or details.

Collision Detection: The program checks if turtles overlap and avoids drawing overlapping ones for a clear display.

Efficient Management: Uses lists to handle many turtles and their positions smoothly.

Smooth Graphics: Uses Javaâ€™s built-in graphics tools for clean and smooth drawings.

Design Principles:
Each class focuses on one part of the turtle or one task.
Uses composition to build the turtle from smaller parts.
Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through clean class relationships.

How to Run
Clone the repository.

Compile all Java files.

Run the main class (TestDrawingTool or equivalent) to see the turtles on screen.
